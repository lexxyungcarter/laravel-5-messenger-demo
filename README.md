# Laravel 5 ChatMessenger Demo (+ Pusher)

This is a demo application for the [Laravel 5 messenger](https://github.com/lexxyungcarter/laravel-5-messenger) to showcase the capabilities for the package.

It is based on [**Laravel 5.7**](https://laravel.com) which is really powerful.

> To get a clear picture of how it works, open two to four browsers (private/incognito mode is perfect for this case) and login with different accounts.

## What's Next

We are working on a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) example since it is a versatile, powerful, and the most popular front-end JS framework.
