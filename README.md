# Laravel 5 & 6 ChatMessenger Demo (+ Pusher)

![Screenshot](acelords-messenger.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot")

This is a demo application for the [Laravel 5 messenger](https://github.com/lexxyungcarter/laravel-5-messenger) to showcase the capabilities for the package.

It is based on [**Laravel 6.x*](https://laravel.com) which is by far the best PHP framework at the time of commit.

## NB
For Laravel versions not supporting php v7.1.3 and up, please refer to `version 1` [v1 branch]. Basically, this applies to Laravel 5.5 and below.

> To get a clear picture of how it works, open two to four browsers (private/incognito mode is perfect for this case) and login with different accounts.

## Donating to the project
If you've found this useful and would like to buy the maintainers a coffee (or a Tesla, we're not picky), feel free to do so.

### Crowdfunding
It's also possible to support the project on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lexxyungcarter) or by buying products and merchandise at [Marketplace](https://store.acelords.space).

This funding is used for maintaining the project and adding new features into Code Style plus other open-source repositories.

## What's Next

We are working on a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) example since it is a versatile, powerful, and the most popular front-end JS framework.
